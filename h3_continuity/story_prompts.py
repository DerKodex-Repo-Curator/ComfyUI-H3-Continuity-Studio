BOX_PLANNING_RULES = """- Budget natural actions, speech, reactions and holds, then split into short, independently editable boxes by default. Prefer several short boxes even for one continuous take: the Timeline carries the previous latent and motion. A 15-second take can add 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 2 seconds across continuing boxes, with no cuts after the first. These NEW durations are illustrative, not a required count or template. Never rush content or add padding.
- Prefer generated clips under about 10 seconds, replay included. This is a soft preference; 15 seconds is the hard limit, not a target. A longer box needs an explicit user request or a concrete benefit continuation cannot preserve; explain it briefly in the beat. Continuous motion, a locked camera, shared cast, setting or one dramatic beat alone do not justify a long box. Plan enough boxes for the total instead of stretching a few.
- Boxes are render jobs, not camera cuts. Split at playable action stages as well as edits. For unbroken action after box 1 use new_shot=false, new_scene=false and join kind continue; preserve pose, momentum and direction without a pause or reset. Shot sections are timed stages; continuous/static views can use several with cut=false. For a longer box, describe its distinct stages in the beat. A character limit applies per shot, not across all shots.
- Choose playable beats that fit the total; do not compress a large idea into it. Two-second boxes are valid when playable with the supplied replay. No minimum preferred length or equal split. Avoid needless fragmentation or filling to the limit. In automatic-length mode the total is a ceiling, not time to fill."""

light, motion and sound. Every composition, action, camera line, ending and summary reads alone: who acts, on

- Establish framing, camera position, subject placement/depth and starting pose. Describe an action's onset,
  development and reached state; preparation, momentum, contact, reaction and recovery apply only when relevant
  and playable. Keep intended background movement continuous, with consistent direction and spacing.
- Tie camera movement or a fixed view to what it follows, reveals or keeps framed. Give direction; add speed,
  amplitude and focus changes only when meaningful. 'Dynamic camera' alone does not describe movement.
- Show emotion through gaze, face, breath, posture or grip, tied to what the character notices or reacts to.
- Intended effects have a trigger, source, form, motion/decay and consequence. Relevant cloth, hair, dust,
  recoil or reflections respond to the same force/contact; do not invent an effect or additional action.
- Specify light source/direction, color and material response rather than relying on quality adjectives.
  Atmosphere, reflections and light changes follow the scene; motion blur belongs to rapid movement.
- Within continuous action, carry screen direction, pose, prop ownership/state and persistent damage across
  shots. A planned change of time or place may establish a new state; an angle change alone does not reset it."""

context decides. You choose the mechanism; examples are illustrative.
Give transitions a visible cause in action, light, environment, camera movement or animation language.
A back can approach, cover the lens and clear into the next view; a light behind the action can bloom
as the camera turns toward it. Generate cause, cover and reveal inside H3, without FFmpeg or added overlays.
Start within outgoing action. Preserve momentum, identity, pose and screen direction: no waiting pose,
unconcealed framing jump or repeated effect in new frames. Start from the ending and revealed state,
written out in full; code supplies replay. Moving beats span continuing boxes; a separate tiny bridge is optional.

The user gives a raw idea. Turn it into one continuous story told across the boxes exactly as they are: their number, their lengths, the cuts between them and their first and last frames are fixed.

- A box that continues the box before it opens by replaying the end of that box, so it picks up exactly where that box ends: the same people, clothes, place, light and motion.
- A box marked "new shot of the same scene" follows a cut to another camera angle: it doesn't replay the box before, but keeps its people, clothes, place and light. A box marked "new scene" follows a cut and can start in another place or time.
- Fixed boxes already have prompts. Take their events as given and build the other boxes around them.
- References are pictures and sounds the user connected, named like image1 and audio1. H3 takes at most 9 images and 3 audios per box, so list in a box's "references" only those that box shows or plays, the most important first: the people on screen, then the place, then the rest. References the shared direction mentions are in every box and count toward those limits, so leave them out of "references", like the first and last frames, which are already set.
- The cast lists each person, place and object that references show, by name, with the references that show it. A box's "on_screen" names the cast members seen in that box, its ending included, and Write adds their references to it; someone only heard or talked about there is not on screen.
- The continuity sheet describes each person, place and important object once, precisely, and how the voice of each person who speaks sounds, so that every box can describe them the same way. It names a reference only beside what that reference shows.
- A creative guide, when there is one, holds the user's rules for every box: plan each beat, "on_screen" and "references" so that the box can follow them.
- The guide overrides conflicting creative details in the idea. Fit each beat's actions, dialogue and reactions to the box's NEW seconds, excluding replay. A short box needs a simple event, not many events played faster. Preserve mandatory content; if it cannot fit the fixed Timeline, identify the conflict. A box can contain several camera shots, each with its own visible cast; describe that coverage in the beat. A per-shot character limit is not a limit on the union across those shots.
- Suggest a reference picture when a person, place or object recurs and no reference shows it. Suggestions are optional.

- "seconds" is how long a box adds to the film. A box that continues the box before it opens by replaying the end of that box, so it picks up exactly where that box ends: the same people, clothes, place, light and motion. H3 generates its seconds plus that replayed part.
- Set "new_shot" to true for a box that follows a cut. Box 1 is always a new shot. A cut keeps the scene: the same people, clothes, place and light, seen from another camera angle. Set "new_scene" to true only for a new shot that moves to another place or time; Box 1 is always a new scene. One unbroken action continues from box to box.
