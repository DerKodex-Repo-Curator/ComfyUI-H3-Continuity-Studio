# Third-party notices

The shot-writing guidance in `h3_continuity/story_prompts.py` is adapted from the [MiniMax H3 Singularity prompt-writing specification](https://huggingface.co/WarmBloodAban/Minimax-h3_Singularity/blob/af671d9214a6e41ab8c2f43e9f871ea56246115f/MiniMax_H3_Singularity_Prompt_Writing_Specification_Enhanced_EN.md) by WarmBloodAban. The upstream repository's model card at that revision identifies Apache-2.0. A copy of the [Apache License 2.0](APACHE-2.0.txt) is provided. The guidance in this project has been adapted; no upstream model weights are included.

The public release omits the MiniMax prompt-guide text. If installed separately, those guides and the MiniMax H3 model have their own terms; see `h3_continuity/h3_guide/NOTICE` and `h3_continuity/h3_guide/LICENSE` and the upstream distribution. Other dependencies and models have their own licenses.

The texture measure in `h3_continuity/check_frames.py` (`texture`) is a NumPy port of `texture_band_rms` from [ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-PrefixStream](https://github.com/knoic/ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-PrefixStream), used under the MIT License:

Paired context noise, audio feather, take ratings and lineage, and per-box video windows follow ideas from the same project. H3 Sigmas Tail follows an idea from [ComfyUI-H3-Motion-Context](https://github.com/NikoDemon80/ComfyUI-H3-Motion-Context) (GPL-3.0); it is an independent implementation and contains none of that project's code.
